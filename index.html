        <p class="descricao-site bordered-top">Twitter is an online social networking tool in which users post 140 character updates (tweets) of what is going on in their lives along with links to things they think are interesting, funny, or useful to their followers (“following” being essentially what “friending” is on other sites). People use twitter in many ways, some as a newsfeed by following prominent people or networks, some as a pseudo-chatroom by limiting their followers and whom they follow to close friends and family, and some as a microblog for updating people about the work they are doing and their personal lives.</p>

        <p>Twitter users choose who they do and do not follow. They have total control of what tweets they see in their home feed. When I refer to your “Home feed”, I’m referring to what you see when you first open the twitter app (or open twitter in the browser). This is different from your personal twitter feed (essentially your “profile” twitter.com/yourusername or the “Me” tab on mobile) which contains all tweets you have created (aside from replies to others, see section below on @ replies. You can have an unlimited amount of followers, but only follow a select few people if you want, making it easy to stay in touch with the people you care to stay in touch with. You cannot control who follows you unless you set your account to “private”, in which case you would need to approve every new follower. Generally, even if you have a public account with lot of strangers following you, it doesn’t alter your experience very much as most will not directly engage with you. (FYI these are fake twitter names, my (the author’s) actual twitter username is <a href="https://twitter.com/jessicahische">@jessicahische.)</a></p>
