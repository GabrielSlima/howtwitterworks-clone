# howtwitterworks-clone

It's a cheap clone from http://www.momthisishowtwitterworks.com/ created by **Jessica Hische**. Why I did that ? Clone things is a 
good way to practice something, you get used to do what you are studying. It's a website telling you how literally Twitter works, it
has a clean and very simple design and layout, perfect to practice Web development using only HTML and CSS!

## HOW DO I THINK TO DO THIS ?

Very simple, draw it in peace of paper!
